- Supports forking, zooming, trashing and favoriting (not yet implemented)
- No configuration needed. Fork, Install and your all set.

### Credits & Inspiration

I wanted to create a pastebin that resembled my own text editor. So i tried to match
the colors, fonts and the UI theme. The style should be minimalistic, and the app
shoud be a SPA. This project is a weekend thing, so dont be suprised if theres code smell.

- **Laravel.io** - This project includes some stuff from the fine & techically superior [Pastebin](http://laravel.io/bin).
- **Dayle Rees** - The prettify css theme is Dayle Reese's [Legacy](http://daylerees.github.io/), the same I use on my ST3.
- **Gadzhi Kharkharov** - For the fine UI design on [SpaceGrey](http://kkga.github.io/spacegray/) for SublimeText.
